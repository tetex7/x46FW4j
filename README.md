# **x46-Framework for JVM**
AKA, ***The-Framework*** and for legacy purposes, *x46-IPP*.

### Java17??
support for Java 17 will come someday as its own separate version of the library.
that probably differs slightly and updates with comes slower because of backports.

### WTF it just crash on WindowsNT and MacOS
yes just it did lol. 


x46FW4j will not work on WindowsNT and MacOS it will only work on Linux.
BSD is on tested but highly probable it will work.  


!!I WILL NOT MAKE A VERSION THAT WORKS ON WINDOWS OR MAC-OS!! but you can compile it yourself to work. you
just have to change a value in the boot.kt file in the internals package the value is WINT flag.

it is highly probable that it will crash if you change this value, but it will not do so intentionally


at this time this is a passion project and will be very crazy into a community can form around it and help standardized
also I am not the greatest at maintaining a constant coding convention but I try

## The Roadmap

1. more optimization on the DSS
2. creating some form of scripting language for the DSS scheduler
3. and etc


It is designed to work with every project from Robots to Little Gadgets in this instance ***The JVM***
